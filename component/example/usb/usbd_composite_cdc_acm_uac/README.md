   * `Download` images to board by Ameba Image Tool.

# Expect result

1. Plugin Reset the board, following log shall be printed on the LOGUART console:
	```
	[COMP-I] USBD COMP demo start
	```

2. Connect the USB port of Ameba board to USB UAC host (for example PC) with USB cable.

3. Launch any serial port tool (e.g. Realtek Trace Tool), open the virtual serial port against the USB port of Ameba board, send messages to the Ameba board and the board will echo back the received messages.

4. After the USB Audio driver is successfully loaded, USB host end will recognize Ameba as an audio device.

5. Play music on a PC, if you connect a speaker to the board, sound will come out.
   ```
	- Open the OS Sound Bar, enable the Realtek Composite Device speaker device if it is disabled. Locate the device in the Device Manager and enable it manually.
	- Open the OS Sound Bar, set Realtek Composite Device Speaker as default device.
	- Open the Sound Control Panel, select the Realtek Composite Device Speaker device -- configure the speakers -- choose a specific channel setup -- finalize the configuration, and then click Test.
	- If you connect a speaker to the board, sound will play.
   ```

6. Reset and check the log via LOGUART console, make sure there is no error reported.

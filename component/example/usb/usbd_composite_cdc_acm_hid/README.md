# Example Description

In this application, Ameba is designed as a USB CDC ACM and HID composite device, USB host can recognize Ameba as a CDC virtual serial port and a HID mouse.

# HW Configuration

None

# SW configuration

1. Menuconfig
	Type command `./menuconfig.py` under the project directory and choose `CONFIG USB`:
	```
	[*] Enable USB
			USB Mode (Device)  --->
	[*] Composite
			Select Composite Class (CDC ACM + HID)  --->
	```
	Save and exit.

2. Build and Download:
   * Refer to the SDK Examples section of the online documentation to generate images.
   * `Download` images to board by Ameba Image Tool.

# Expect result

1. Reset the board, following log shall be printed on the LOGUART console, make sure there is no USB related error reported:
	```
	[COMP-I] USBD COMP demo start
	```

2. Connect the USB port of Ameba board to PC with USB cable.

3. Launch any serial port tool (e.g. Realtek Trace Tool), open the virtual serial port against the USB port of Ameba board, send messages to the Ameba board and the board will echo back the received messages.

4. Type following command from Ameba LOGUART console to send mouse data to PC:
	```
	# mouse <left> <right> <middle> <x_axis> <y_axis> <wheel>
	```
	E.g., to move mouse cursor to right by 50 pixels:
	```
	# mouse 0 0 0 50 0 0
	```
	Then the position of PC mouse pointer shall be changed accordingly.

# Note

Specially for Win7/XP host, please manually install the CDC ACM driver RtkUsbCdcAcmSetup.INF, and before the installation, please make sure the VID/PID value used in CDC ACM class is included in the INF file:

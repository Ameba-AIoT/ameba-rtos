Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
	In this application, Ameba is designed as an USB MSC host which can communicate with USB MSC device such as U-disk.
    
Setup Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~
	Taking AmebaSmart in GCC environmnet for example.

	Firstly, please make sure USB host mode is supported by the Ameba board hardware, specially for RTL8730EA/QFN100
	boards, the register R20 shall be parted on with 0Ohm register or just shorted to provide power for USB device
	via VBUS. Please refer to USB AN for details.

	To run USB MSC host application on AP:
	1. Make sure FF_LFN_UNICODE is set to 2 in component/file_system/fatfs/<version>/include/ffconf.h (default)
	2. Type command "make menuconfig" under auto_build 
	   choose MENUCONFIG FOR AP CONFIG => CONFIG USB:
		[*] Enable USB
		(HOST_MODE) USB Mode
		[*] MSC
	   choose CONFIG_VFS:
		[*] Enable VFS FATFS 
	Save and exit.
	3. Type command "make all EXAMPLE=usbh_msc" under auto_build to build the images.
	4. Download the generated images under auto_build to Ameba board.
	5. Plugin Reset the board, following log shall be printed on the LOGUART console, make sure there is no USB related
	error reported:
		[MSC] USB host MSC demo started...
	6. Attach an U disk formatted with FATFS to the USB port of the board with USB OTG cable. 
	7. Ameba board will recoganize the MSC device and do write/read performance test, check the log on the LOGUART console
	and make sure there is no USB related error reported.
		
	To run USB MSC host application on HP:
	1. Type command "make menuconfig" under auto_build
	   choose MENUCONFIG FOR HP CONFIG => CONFIG USB:
		[*] Enable USB
		(HOST_MODE) USB Mode
		[*] MSC
	   choose CONFIG_VFS:
		[*] Enable VFS FATFS
	Save and exit.
	2. Type command "make all" under auto_build and type "make EXAMPLE=usbh_msc" under project_hp to build the images.
	3. Download the generated images under project_hp to Ameba board.
	4-7. Same with steps for AP.

	For other chips, refer to the AN for setup guide.

Parameter Setting and Configuration

		Register USB disk driver
		FATFS Register: disk driver 0
		FatFS USB Write/Read performance test started...

# Example Description

In this application, Ameba is designed as an USB CDC ACM device, USB host can recognize Ameba as a virtual serial port and communicate with it via serial port tools.

# HW Configuration

None

# SW configuration

1. Menuconfig
	Type command `./menuconfig.py` under the project directory and choose `CONFIG USB`:
	```
	[*] Enable USB
			USB Mode (Device)  --->
	[*] 	CDC ACM
	```
	Save and exit.

2. Build and Download:
   * Refer to the SDK Examples section of the online documentation to generate images.
   * `Download` images to board by Ameba Image Tool.

# Expect result

1. Reset the board, following log shall be printed on the LOGUART console, make sure there is no USB related error reported:
	```
	[ACM-I] USBD CDC ACM demo start
	```

2. Connect the USB port of Ameba board to USB host (PC or another Ameba board as USB CDC ACM host) with USB cable.

3. Launch any serial port tool (e.g. Realtek Trace Tool), open the virtual serial port against the USB port of Ameba board, send messages to the Ameba board and the board will echo back the received messages.

# Note

Specially for Win7/XP host, please manually install the CDC ACM driver RtkUsbCdcAcmSetup.INF, and before the installation, please make sure the VID/PID value used in CDC ACM class is included in the INF file:

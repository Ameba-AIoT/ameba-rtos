# Expect result

1. A softap will be started automatically after booting.

2. Use atcmd to connect to the public WiFi under sta mode, then use cellphone to connect to softap.  
If sta has linked to public WiFi before, it will connect to it automatically by fast connect after booting which means you don't have to use atcmd.

3. If sta has successfully connected to public WiFi which can access wan, then cellphone can also access wan.

# Note

   - Use CMD `AT+WLCONN=ssid,xxx,pw,xxx`; if public WiFi is set with password otherwise don't need `pw,xxx`.

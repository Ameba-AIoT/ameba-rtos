# Uart Example

This example demonstrates how to use the WIFI-CAST data to communicate between devices.

## Functionality

One device receives data through the user-defined serial port and broadcasts to other devices through WIFI-CAST data. Other devices will output the data through the loguart when receive the data.

## Setup Enviornment

At least two Ameba development boards are needed. Choose one board to connect user-defined serial port with a USB-UART adapter and works as the sender, and another board works as the receiver.

> Note: The role of `sender` and `receiver` will be on the devices at the same time. When user connect user-defined serial port with a USB-UART adapter on one device, this device acts as sender and sends data to other devices. The device receives the data will act as receiver. 

## User-defined Frame Format

Config the user-defined data header in User Payload field.
|   Type   |   Len   | 
|:--------:|:-------:|
|  2 bytes | 2 bytes |
* Type: The Type field is set to indicate the WIFI-CAST uart data.
    ```
    #define WIFI_CAST_UART_DATA		BIT(13)
    ```
* Len: The Len field is set as the length of uart data.

## How to Use the Example

### Step 1: Configure the Serial Port

The default PIN in the example is set as below, change them if necessary.
```
#define UART_TX_PIN    PA_28
#define UART_RX_PIN    PA_29
```
The default baudrate is set to 1500000 bps, change it if necessary.
```
#define UART_BAUD_RATE 1500000
```
Ther default buffer size is set to 200, change it if necessary.
```
#define UART_RX_BUF_SZ	200
```

### Step 2: Connect the Serial Port

Choose one board as the sender and connect the user-defined serial port with PC serial terminal through an USB-UART adapter.

### Step 3: Build & Flash

Build and Download:
   * Refer to the SDK Examples section of the online documentation to generate images.
   * `Download` images to board by Ameba Image Tool(Download the image into flash both sender and receiver).

### Step 4: Run Sender and Receiver

1. Reset both sender and receiver.
2. The sender inputs data through the user-defined serial port.

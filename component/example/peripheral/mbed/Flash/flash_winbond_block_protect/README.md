# Example Description

This example demonstrates how to configure the status register of Winbond to protect all blocks by MBED API. Note that the status register should be reset if users want to reload code. 

This example does not support the loguart command response.

# HW Configuration

Winbond Nor Flash

# SW Configuration

Replace the original main.c under sdk project (project\realtek_amebaxxx_va0_example\src\src_xxx) with the main.c in the example directory. Then re-build project. 

For AmebaSmart, please compile it in CA32(ap) core. 

# Expected Result

If the test passed, the log will be printed:

```
Test Address = 180000
Before Lock
Success 1
Lock
Status Register Before Setting: 0x00
Success 2

Status Register After Setting: 0x1c
Success 3
Status Register After Reset: 0x00
Result is success
```

# Example Description

This example describes how to use JPEG decoder to decode a JPEG file to YCbCr data in `slice mode` under JPEG decoder standalone mode.

# HW Configuration

None

# SW Configuration

Build and Download:
   * Refer to the SDK Examples section of the online documentation to generate images.
   * `Download` images to board by Ameba Image Tool.

# Expected Result

If successful, it will print "JPEGDEC_SLICE_READY" for 4 times, and "JpegDecDecode OK" for the last time. Otherwise, it will print "error".

# Note

A board with PSRAM is required to meet the need for large memory usage.

# Supported IC

# Example Description

This example shows how to enter deepsleep mode and configure wakeup source 

This example does not support the loguart command response.

# HW Configuration
AON_WAKEPIN_WAKEUP wakeup operation:
* On AmebaSmart,
	- Connect PB_21 or PB_22 to GND
	- Connect PB_21 or PB_22 to V3.3
	- PB_23 and PB_24 is for loguart now, contact RTK if need
* On AmebaLite,
	- Connect PA_0 or PA_1 to to GND
	- Connect PA_0 or PA_1 to V3.3
* On AmebaDplus,
	- Connect PB_30 or PB_31 to to GND
	- Connect PB_30 or PB_31 to V3.3

# SW Configuration

1. Choose wakeup source by setting AON_WAKEPIN_IDX in main.c: AON_TIMER_WAKEUP, AON_WAKEPIN_WAKEUP
2. Choose Pin Index for wakepin by static parameter :
	* On AmebaSmart, WAKEPIN_0 for PB_21, WAKEPIN_1 for PB_22
	* On AmebaLite, WAKEPIN_0 for PA_0, WAKEPIN_1 for PA_1
	* On AmebaDplus, WAKEPIN_0 for PB_30, WAKEPIN_1 for PB_31

3. How to compile :
	- Copy main.c under folder src to project\realtek_amebaxxx_va0_example\src\src_xxx
		* On AmebaSmart, src_xxx should be src_ap
		* On AmebaLite, src_xxx should be src_KM4 if KM4 is AP core, or src_xxx should be src_KR4 if KR4 is AP core
		* On AmebaDplus,src_xxx should be src_KM4


# Expected Result

1. AON_TIMER_WAKEUP: chip will wakeup from dslp after timeout, log will show "dslp wake from aontimer"
2. AON_WAKEPIN_WAKEUP: chip will wakeup from dslp after wakepin level change to the target level, log will show "dslp wake from wakepin"
	- if sleep_wakepin_config[] set to HIGH_LEVEL_WAKEUP, chip will wakeup from dslp after corresponding wakepin level change from low level to high level
	- if sleep_wakepin_config[] set to LOW_LEVEL_WAKEUP, chip will wakeup from dslp after corresponding wakepin level change from high level to low level

# Note

1. if AON wakepin is wakeup source, sleep_wakepin_config[] in ameba_sleepcfg.c and pmap_func in ameba_pimapcfg.c also need be set.
	- for wakepin high level wakeup
		* set "config" attribute of corresponding wakepin to HIGH_LEVEL_WAKEUP in sleep_wakepin_config[]
		* set Func PU/PD and Slp PU/PD of of corresponding wakepin to GPIO_PuPd_DOWN in pmap_func[]
	- for wakepin low level wakeup
		* set "config" attribute of corresponding wakepin to LOW_LEVEL_WAKEUP in sleep_wakepin_config[]
		* set Func PU/PD and Slp PU/PD of of corresponding wakepin to GPIO_PuPd_UP in pmap_func[]
2. For AmebaSmart, enter cmd "~tickps dslp" firstly after boot, let KM4 release lock is needed.
3. This example will not run in loop, which means it will keep active after wake up once.

# Supported IC

* AmebaSmart
* AmebaLite
* AmebaDplus

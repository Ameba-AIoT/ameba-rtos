## About <a name = "about"></a>

Ameba audio project can achieve:
1. audio patch, for example, capture I2S0's data and directly send to I2S1 by hardware.
2. before using this example, please check the application note to see how to choose audio architecture and compile.
3. please check the application note to see how to use interfaces.

## Supported IC <a name = "supported-ic"></a>
1. AmebaDplus(only support passthrough architecture)

## Configurations <a name = "configurations"></a>

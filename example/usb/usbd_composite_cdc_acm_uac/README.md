# Example Description

In this application, Ameba is designed as a USB CDC ACM and UAC composite device, USB host can recognize Ameba as a CDC virtual serial port and a audio speaker.

# HW Configuration

None

# SW configuration

1. Menuconfig
	Use menuconfig and :
	- Choose `CONFIG USB --->`:
	```
	[*] Enable USB
			USB Mode (Device)  --->
		*** USB Device Global Settings ***
	[*] Composite function enable
		*** USB Device Class Selection ***
	[*] CDC ACM
	[*] UAC
			Select UAC Version (UAC 1.0)  --->
	```
	- Choose `CONFIG APPLICATION --->` -> `Audio Config --->`:
	```
	[*] Enable Audio Framework
			Select Audio Interfaces (Mixer)  --->

	Note: For details on audio configuration, please refer to https://aiot.realmcu.com/en/latest/rtos/multimedia/audio/index.html
	```

	If the development board model is RTL8721F, please follow the steps below to select FREERTOS via menuconfig.
	Use menuconfig and :
	- Choose `CONFIG OS --->`:
	```
	[*] Enable Kernel
			Kernel Selecte (FREERTOS)--->
	```
	Save and exit.

2. Build and Download:
   * Refer to the SDK Examples section of the online documentation to generate images.
   * `Download` images to board by Ameba Image Tool.

# Expect result

1. Reset the board, following log shall be printed on the LOGUART console. The test PASSes only if the lines below show up and no error level log (`-E`) is reported:
	```
	[USBD-A] INIT
	[COMP-I] USBD ACM+UAC comp demo start
	[COMP-I] ATTACHED
	```
	Notes:
	* `[USBD-A] INIT` comes from the USB device core, not from the example.
	* `[COMP-I] ATTACHED` is printed once the USB host has enumerated the device, so it only shows up after the cable is connected.
	* On AmebaGreen2 an extra `[USB-I] UPHY para from ...` line is printed by the USB HAL before `[USBD-A] INIT`.

2. Connect the USB port of Ameba board to USB UAC host (for example PC) with USB cable.

3. Launch any serial port tool (e.g. Realtek Trace Tool), open the virtual serial port against the USB port of Ameba board, send messages to the Ameba board and the board will echo back the received messages. The echo data path prints no log.

4. After the USB Audio driver is successfully loaded, USB host end will recognize Ameba as an audio device.

5. Play music on a PC, if you connect a speaker to the board, sound will come out.
   ```
	- Open the OS Sound Bar, enable the Realtek ACM+UAC Composite Device speaker device if it is disabled. Locate the device in the Device Manager and enable it manually.
	- Open the OS Sound Bar, set Realtek ACM+UAC Composite Device Speaker as default device.
	- Open the Sound Control Panel, select the Realtek ACM+UAC Composite Device Speaker device -- configure the speakers -- choose a specific channel setup -- finalize the configuration, and then click Test.
	- If you connect a speaker to the board, sound will play.
   ```

6. Once the host selects an audio format and starts the stream, the playback worker brings up the audio track and following log is printed:
	```
	[COMP-I] Audio track demo begin
	[COMP-I] Audio ch:2,rate:48000,bits=16
	[COMP-I] Track buf size:<value>
	[COMP-I] UAC stop 0
	```
	The reported channel count, sample rate and bit width shall match the format selected on the host side. The playback data path itself prints no log. On a build without the audio framework (`CONFIG_SUPPORT_AUDIO_FOR_USB` disabled) the audio track is not created, and a `[COMP-I] Audio track get <len> <total>` line is printed every 200 reads instead.

7. Hotplug check: the example tears down and re-inits the whole composite stack on every detach, so unplug and re-plug the cable, following log shall be printed for each cycle:
	```
	[COMP-I] DETACHED
	[USBD-A] DEINIT
	[COMP-I] Free heap: 0x<value>
	[USBD-A] INIT
	[COMP-I] ATTACHED
	```
	The `Free heap` value shall stay stable across cycles, a value that keeps dropping indicates a memory leak.

# Note

Specially for Win7/XP host, please manually install the CDC ACM driver RtkUsbCdcAcmSetup.INF, and before the installation, please make sure the VID/PID value used in CDC ACM class is included in the INF file:
